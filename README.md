# Predicting-Cardiac-Arrhythmia
Most deaths occur around the world because of cardiac disorders. Cardiac rhythm disorders may cause severe strokes and heart diseases. Arrythmiaâ€™s occur when the electric signals to the heart are irregular or not working properly. Mostly, these irregular heartbeats feel like racing hearts. Many times, Arrythmias are harmless, but if they are abnormal or they result due to damaged heart then they can be fatal. Cardiac-arrythmia being the leading cause of death in both men and women, can be prevented with early and correct diagnosis. In this paper, the focus is mainly on predicting whether the patient has cardiac arrythmia or not based on ECG (Electrocardiography) reports. Pan Tompkins Algorithm has been used for QRS detection which predicts the abnormal deflections that lead to the arrhythmic events. The same reports have been used to classify which type of cardiac arrhythmia the patient has using MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) algorithm.
